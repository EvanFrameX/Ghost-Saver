# Ghost-Saver
Saving locally, but safelly


# Disclaimer
The folder is always created in the same directory as the file itself, so you should put the file in a folder somewhere private, like in the same directory of apps like Chrome and other stuff
But you could run into problems like not having admin access, therefore not generating new folders or uploading files correctly
